# Install Chrome on Render Native Environment test

This is a bare bones Express app (based on the [Render Express example](https://github.com/render-examples/express-hello-world)) to test installing Google Chrome on a Render Native Environment.

## Deployment

Create a new web service with the following values:
  * Build Command: `./render-build.sh`
  * Start Command: `./render-start.sh`

That's it! Your web service will be live on your Render URL as soon as the build finishes.
